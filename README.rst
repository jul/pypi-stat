Graphing previously stored statistics about pipy
************************************************



Can be graphed : 
 
 * av_dl average download
 * max_dl maximum download
 * min_dl fewest download 

All these keys can be combined. 

Output is a file YYYY-MM-DD-pack1,pack2-stat.png in current dir  plus a matplotlib output (that does not work here:( )
 
output can be limited to only one of these by using --do save or --do plot. 

date are meant to be entered in isoformat "%Y-%m-%d"

BUG : ax.autoscale dont work on first graph :'( 
for accurate results I do recommand using doing stat one package per one package


 $ ./pypi_graph_stat.py -h
 Usage: pypi_graph_stat.py [options]
 
 Options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   -k KEY                keys to plot in stored stats
   -f _FROM, --from=_FROM
                         min date
   -t _TO, --to=_TO      to
   -a _ACTION, --do=_ACTION
                         action to do in save & show      *show* orders a
                         matplotlib show, *save* saves the graph in YYYYY-MM-
                         DD-pakkage1,package2-stat.png" in the      current dir
   -p _PACKAGE, --package=_PACKAGE
                         packages for wich to graph
